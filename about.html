      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <h3>Hey there! Yohans Addis who is 18 years old continues his passion for business along with meme coin trading. I reside in Ethiopia while attending the 11th grade and continuously work to learn more skills.

You can spot me during leisure time either playing video games or watching anime or hacking different electronic devices since I find fulfillment in enhancing things through disassembly. Soaketimes of social activities suit me well but other times I need personal space to rest and progress in my goals.

I aim to build a successful business career with a specific interest in combining crypto and trading operations. I embrace risk-taking while planning for the future together with continuous improvements to my own self. The website functions as my platform to distribute my experiences together with my thoughts and interests.
