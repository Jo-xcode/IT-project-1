      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <p>Hey there! I'm Yohans Addis, an 18-year-old with a passion for business and meme coin trading. I currently live in Ethiopia and am in 11th grade, always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills.

In my free time, you'll often find me gaming, watching anime, or modifying electronic devices—there’s something exciting about taking things apart and making them better. While I enjoy socializing, I also appreciate being alone sometimes to recharge and focus on my goals.

My dream is to become a successful businessman, especially in the world of crypto and trading. I believe in taking risks, thinking ahead, and always improving myself. This website is a space where I share my interests, experiences, and thoughts—so stick around!
